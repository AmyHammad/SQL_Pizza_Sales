# Total Revenue:

SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales


# Average Order Value

SELECT SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Avg_Order_Value FROM pizza_sales 

# Total Pizzas Sold:

SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold FROM pizza_sales

# Total Orders

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders FROM pizza_sales

#Average Pizza Per Order:

SELECT CAST(CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / 
CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS DECIMAL(10,2))
AS Avg_Pizzas_per_order
FROM pizza_sales

//
- **`SUM(quantity)`** → Adds up the total number of pizzas sold across all orders.
    
- **`COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`** → Counts how many **unique orders** were made.
    
- **`CAST(... AS DECIMAL(10,2))`** → Ensures both `SUM(quantity)` and `COUNT(...)` return **decimal values** (like `204.00`, `57.00`) before dividing.
    
- **Division:** We divide the **decimal total quantity** by the **decimal total orders**, so we get a **decimal result**.
    
- **Final `CAST(... AS DECIMAL(10,2))`** → Rounds the final result to **2 decimal places**, e.g., `3.58`.
